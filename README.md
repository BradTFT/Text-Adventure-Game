# Text-Adventure-Game
Ive decided to make a basic text adventure game. this will teach me a lot of stuff.


**4.13.22:**
First day. Init git and readied first files.

damage and health loss/gain will be based off a dice roll.(random lib will make diceroll easy)
i need to make a dice roll outcome system. my idea is 2 dice rolls. one is the attempt and it will roll between 1-38 and one is the outcome. if the outcome is higher than the attempt then the attack, ect. is successful and vise versa. if the numbers are equal then it fails.
im going to test this in another file then add it after. 
roll test was successful and the process is inside the **roll-test.py** file. 
just learned that i need to do something more complicated then just if else. according to the discord i need to learn event driven patterns. so this is gonna be a learning day.
