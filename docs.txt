game doumentation here:


Ok. first day, basic layout of the game. i want a basic rpg type game with a health system and a decision making story

health system is a life interval(1+, 1-, 0.5+, 0.5-)

i want to add a weapon system with durability ect.

damage and health loss/gain will be based off a dice roll.(random lib will make diceroll easy)
i need to make a dice roll outcome system. my idea is 2 dice rolls. one is the attempt and it will roll between 1-38 and one is the outcome. if the outcome is higher than the attempt then the attack, ect. is successful and vise versa. if the numbers are equal then it fails.
im going to test this in another file then add it after. 
roll test was successful and the process is inside the file.
